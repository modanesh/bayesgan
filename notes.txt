--num_disc: same as J_D in the paper; number of samples of z to integrate it out for discriminators; default 1
--num_mcmc: same as M in the paper; number of MCMC NN weight samples per z; default 1
--batch_size: batch size for training; default 64
--num_layers: number of layers for G and D nets which are 5 in the paper
